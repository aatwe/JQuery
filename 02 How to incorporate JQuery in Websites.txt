1) how to download JQuery?
	
	a) Download code from Website

	b) CDN
		Use Google CDN for JQuery
		  why google CDN better? if user has been to other website with same CDN to fetch JQuery library
			It will already be cached and saved in their browser
			when user accessing your website, they dont have to fetch fresh copy of JQuery

2) Create a new JQuery Project
Link up css and js


3) How to import JQuery using CDN ? (place above .js)  both on top or both at end of website body
	//doesnt work if placed below why? browser reads top to bottom and processes 1) index.js ,2) tries to implement jQuery first from index.js
	
	What if Jquery and index.js are in <head>? doesnt work + no error given DISASTER

5) How to perform quick check if jquery has been loaded?
$(document).ready(function()){
 $("h1").css("color","red");
})

4)Write JQuery to Change h1 color to red? Select h1 and and change css color to red

index.html:
!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
